## Algorithms & Problem Solving (Python)

This repo is made with the purpose to master algorithms, build efficient systems
This repo is one of many to come this year.

Mantra:
"I don’t break streaks — I build futures."

## How to benefit the contents of that repo?
In this repo, I work on multiple algorithms (searching, sorting...) the .py files are the functions, the names of the .py file indicate which algorithm implemented. The NOTES.md file actually describes/explains the logic behind each algorithms. What makes the contents great for learning and facilitate implementations.
